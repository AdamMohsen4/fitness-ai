# Smart(er) Pedometer App 

An "AI-powered"ðŸ™„(I know...) step counter app built with React Native and Expo. The thought is to have a "narrative" llm integration that retroactively (or in real-time) provides fun facts based on route coordinates.

## Features

- Real-time step counting using device sensors
- Daily goal tracking with visual progress
- Statistics dashboard (calories, distance, time)
- Subjectively good looking UI
- Goal achievement celebrations

## Requirements

- Store user data and provide seemingly customized workout recommendations based on parameters like weight, acivity level, age, etc
- Wrap feature with LLM (motivational speaker, guide, or some other fun thing)
- Accururate data and fast retrievals 
- Offline tracking functionality and syncing when connected to network again

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```
